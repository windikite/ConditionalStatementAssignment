My second assignment, working with conditional statements in various ways.

1. Problem 1 required me to fix buggy code that was checking if various numbers were positive, negative or zero.

2. Problem 2 was a bit difficult as these problems usually are for me, since logical math is not my forte. The third task shows my full solution. The checker at the bottom will work for every task, something I like to do with multi-stage problems.

3. The last one was pretty easy. Just had to use conditional comparisons with modulus to compare the remainder after division. If it was 0 then it was evenly divisible and would pass the checks for a leap year. 

Since it's usually these sorts of problems that I have the hardest time with, not setting up server routing, I will have to focus on this.
